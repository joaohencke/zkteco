# ZKTeco

## What I need?

- Node >= 10
- Yarn

## How to?

- Install dependencies typing: `yarn`
- Run script typing: `yarn start`


## Rules

- By default we expect `|` as delimiter, but you can change it by setting `DELIMITER` as env variable;
- By default we expect `./users.txt` to be the file location, but you can change it by setting `FILE_PATH` as env variable;
- We expect the file to be like: 
```
ipDevice|idUser
127.0.0.1|xQnqa1
127.0.0.1|oqKnql
```
